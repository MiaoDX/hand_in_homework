Disclaimer: All things here is just my own opinion, just treat it as a joke if you really disagree.

* Really sick :)

Or,

* Clone/Gene Tech
* Nuclear Power
* Robots, Computer, AI


# AI

    - Amazon
    - Facebook
    - Microsoft

# The Future

---

>不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中
> -- 苏轼『题西林壁』

150 years ago, there were not cars, now we send human into outer space.

30 years ago (Sep. 1987), China send out the first email.

>Across the Great Wall we can reach every corner in the world
>（越过长城，走向世界）

Now, almost everyone have the access to internet.

25 years ago, most of us have not arrive into the world, now, we are ... 

## So, just image

You have a parter:

* who can cheer you up when you're upset
* who can alway chat to you or keep silent as you wish
* who remember each and everything you need to keep in mind
* who take care of your heath like a outstanding doctor or export coach in gym
* who make you breakfast, lunch, and supper like a chief cook of restaurant in "Le Guide Michelin"
* who looks exactly like the one you want to marry but have no chance
* who can also kid around if you want that

---

PLEASE add the list as you wish.

Just one tiny issue, he/she is a robot under perfect human skin with emotion just like human.

>A: So, what do you think?

>B: I don't by it, but will buy if true.


## A new world

* you have the power to choose whoever you are, do whatever you want to do
* you don't have to work extremely hard in your whole life to pay for a room less than $100m^2$
* you don't have to spend years with a girl/boy and be left alone
* you don't have to suffer relatives or very close friends pass away

---

Just like the former one, the only issue is all there are virtual, but so real that you just can not tell the difference.

Maybe you think it disgusting, then, just treat it as pill for some who really need a big lie to be alive.


## Or maybe

Someone insane just start the nuclear war, and like what has been said in the Bible:

>${}^{10}$但主的日子要像贼来到一样；那日，天必大有响声废去，有形质的都要被烈火销化，地和其上的物都要烧尽了。
>
> -- 『新约·彼得后书·第三章』


## Mission & Vision

I do hope maybe 45 or 50 years later, I can introduce robots or AI like I described before to the public.
