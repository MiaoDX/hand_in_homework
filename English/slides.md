# The Future

---

>不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中
> -- 苏轼『题西林壁』

150 years ago, there were no cars, now we send human into outer space.

30 years ago (Sep. 1987), China sent out the first email:

>Across the Great Wall we can reach every corner in the world
>（越过长城，走向世界）

Now, almost everyone has the access to Internet.

25 years ago, most of us have not come into this world, now, we are... 

## So, just image

You have a partner:

* who can cheer you up when you're upset
* who can always chat to you or keep silent as you wish
* who remember each and every stuff you need to keep in mind
* who take care of your health like a outstanding doctor or expert coach in gym
* who make you breakfast, lunch, and supper like a chief cook of restaurant in "Le Guide Michelin"
* who looks exactly like the one you want to marry in dream but have no chance in reality
* who can also kid around if you want that

---

PLEASE add the list as you wish.

Just one tiny issue, he/she is a robot under perfect human skin with emotion just like human.

>A: So, what do you think?
>
>B: I don't buy it, but will buy if true.


## A new world

* you have the power to choose whoever you are, do whatever you want to do
* you don't have to work extremely hard in your whole life to pay for a room less than $100m^2$
* you don't have to spend years with a girl/boy and being left alone
* you don't have to suffer relatives or very close friends pass away

---

Just like the former one, the only issue is all there are virtual, but so real that you just cannot tell the difference.

Maybe you think it disgusting, then, just treat it as a pill for some who really need a big lie to keep alive.


Or maybe

Someone insane just start the nuclear war, and like what has been said in the Bible:

---

>${}^{10}$但主的日子要像贼来到一样；那日，天必大有响声废去，有形质的都要被烈火销化，地和其上的物都要烧尽了。
>
> -- 『新约・彼得后书・第三章』


>${}^{10}$But Jehovah’s day will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar, but the elements being intensely hot will be dissolved, and earth and the works in it will be exposed.
>
> -- 『2 Peter. 3:10 Christian Greek Scriptures』

## Mission & Vision

I do hope maybe 42 years later, I can introduce robots or AI like I described before to the public.
