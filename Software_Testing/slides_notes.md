# Slides Notes (and exam preparation)

## Ch01-Introduction

Software Testing ==(in some view) Verification (do thing right) + Validation (do right thing)

## Ch02-ST Foundations

### Terminology

* Fault: the mistake in code
* Error: execute the wrong code
* Failure: execute the wrong code and get wrong output


RIP model: three conditions for a failure to be observed:

* Reachability: wrong code can be executed
* Infection: wrong code executed and cause somewhat wrong in program
* Propagation: wrong results

## Ch04-Graph Coverage

* Control flow graph coverage
* Data flow graph coverage

### reach

* syntactic reach: a subpath exists in the graph
* semantic reach: a test exists that can execute that subpath

### Types of graph coverage

* NC, Node Coverage
* EC, Edge Coverage
* EPC, Edge-Pair Coverage
* CPC, Complete Path Coverage
* SPC, Specified Path Coverage
* PPC, Prime Path Coverage (see below)


As for graph with loops:

* Simple Path: No repeat node expect in possibly first and last node are same situation.
* Prime Path: SP, and not subpath of other SP.


Example of Prime Path:

![pp_example](pics/pp_example.png){#fig:pp_example width=50%}


### CFG, Control Flow Graph

The `dummy`/`extra` nodes when `loops` are presented.

And there are some examples of common used control flow statements:

![if](pics/if.PNG){#fig:if width=50%}

![while_for](pics/while_for.PNG){#fig:while_for width=50%}

![do_loop](pics/do_loop.PNG){#fig:do_loop width=50%}

![switch](pics/switch.PNG){#fig:switch width=50%}


## Ch05-Logic Coverage

Types of logic coverage:

* Decision Coverage (i.e. branch coverage)
* Condition Coverage
* Condition/Decision Coverage
* Multiple-condition Coverage
* MC/DC (Modified condition/decision coverage) Coverage


Decision & Condition:

* Decision: ans of an expression with possible many boolean operator `and`,`or`,`not`
* Condition: individual boolean expression (with no boolean operator)

An easy example:

``` cpp
if(A && B){
    [...]
}
else{
    [...]
}
```

* Decision Coverage: 

Only need the answer of `if` expression be `true` and `false` once, test case can be:
`(A=true,B=true), (A=true,B=false)`.

Note that, in both case A is always true, so Condition Coverage is not achieved.

* Condition Coverage:

Test cases can be `(A=true,B=false),(A=false,B=true)`, thus DC is not achieved.

* Condition/Decision Coverage:

Cover both, but still need not to cover all possible combination:

`(true,true),(false,false)` is enough.

* Multiple Condition Coverage

All possible combination, $2^k$ cases.

* MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage):

`Each` simple condition within the compound condition has an `independent effect` on its outcome.



``` vi
T1 (true,true) true
T2 (false,true) false
T3 (true,false) false
```

Thus, T1 and T2 can cover C1, T1 and T3 can cover C2.


SO, `MCC > MC/DC > (CC, DC)`

## Ch06-Blackbox Testing

### Single input parameter blackbox testing

* Equivalence class partitioning (ECP, 等价类), integer: {negative/zero/positive}
* Boundary value analysis (BVA, 边界值), the boundary cases for each equivalence class in ECP, integer: {MAX_INT, MAX_INT-1, -1, 0, 1, MIN_INT+1, MIN_INT}
* Cause-effect graph and decision table (因果图与决策表)

Decision table:

Condition + Action -> Policy. And simplify this table to be minimal (Some conditions are the same underneath).

Design test case for each column of decision table.

Cause-effect graph:

Make cause-effect graph and translate it to decision table.


### Combination of input parameters

Pairwise methods.
>绝大部分缺陷是在两个变量取值冲突的测试被发现的。


## Ch08-TDD,Stub and Mock

* Stub: 对真实对象的模拟，显性存在，关注状态（state testing）
* Mock: 模拟出一个被模拟对象的实例，隐形存在，关注交互（interaction testing）

## Ch09-Load Testing

* Load test, 负载测试
* Stress test, how application behaves under maximum load
* Performance test
