# Introduction

## What I am doing?

* Get synthesized datasets from virtual environments
* Use the datasets for computer vision algorithms
* Combine virtual environments with Reinforcement Learning (ML/DL)

## Why it matters?

* create database with ease
* configurable environments
* repeatable experiments
* accurate ground truth

## What we can do with all these

* data collection
* training set for algorithms
* performance measurements (extra testing set) for algorithms

## What it to do with Computer Graphics

Take advantage of existing advance in rending/texture/simulation ... technologies:

To be more specific, we concentrate on one of the most widely used game engine -- Unreal 4

And what's more, it is open-sourced.

[It can generate really `real` images and simulation of various physical movements]

## What it to do beyond Graphics?

The ML/DL/RL is an pretty hot area now, and we are expected to have this ability when we are seeking a job.

So, get our toes wet with it is worthy and this project can do some help to it. Especially the combination of virtual world with RL algorithms part.

Plus, it's interesting :)

# Changelog

How the project has changed overtime.

# Project Overview

> We are not producing water, we are only the hamals of nature.

I am not create something new, rather I reproduce/combine existing projects and provide a systematic guideline for newbies.

## General View

## General View -- the outline


* Main subject
    - unrealcv
    - gym_unrealcv

* System/hardware requirements
    - Ubuntu 16.04
    - GPU (GTX 980 tested)

* Software
    - CUDA 8.0
    - Opencv 2.4.13

## Step by step guide for the whole environment

Can be found in [my write-ups](this is a website page)

## Workload of me (expect the set up of the environments)

* Integrate unrealcv with faster rcnn tensorflow implements (two version)
* Demo of how to evaluate the existing algorithms

# Case study

## That's all

Great thanks to Ms. Wan for your classes and project assignment.

And all of our classmates.

What's more, it's the last presentation for me in my first year in graduate life.

> Good Luck & Have Fun!
