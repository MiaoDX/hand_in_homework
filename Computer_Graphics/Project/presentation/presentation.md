# Introduction

***
## What I am doing?

* Get synthesized datasets from virtual environments
* Use the datasets for computer vision algorithms
* Combine virtual environments with Reinforcement Learning (ML/DL)

***
## Why it (synthetic way) matters?

* Create database with ease
* Configurable environments
* Repeatable experiments
* Accurate ground truth

***

***
## What we can do with all these?

* Collecting data 
* Training set for algorithms
* Evaluating existing algorithms (extra testing set)
* Integrating it with other platforms and provide environments for training

***
## Synthetic computer vision & Computer Graphics

Take advantage of existing technology advances in lighting, cameras, materials, shaders & textures, particles & visual effects ...

. . .

To be more specific, one of the most widely used game engine -- Unreal 4

. . .

And, it is open-sourced (unlike Unity 3D)

It can generate highly **near-photo-realistic indoor scenes** and simulate various physical movements.

***
## Beyond Graphics?

The ML/DL/RL is an pretty hot area now, and we are expected to have the ability when we are seeking a job.

. . .

So, get our toes wet with it is worthy and this project can do some help to it. Especially the combination of virtual world with RL algorithms part.

. . .

Plus, it's interesting :)

# Changelog

This project have changed a lot from the very beginning.

. . .

Dropped:

* GTA V

# Project Overview

. . .

> We don't produce water. We are porters of nature.

I am not create something new, rather I reproduce/combine existing projects and provide a systematic guidance    for newbies.

## General View

![Project overview](pics/gym_unrealcv.png){width=70%}

Picture changed from [zfw1226/gym-unrealcv](https://github.com/zfw1226/gym-unrealcv)

We add some examples on the unrealcv side.

    - python 2.7
    - tensorflow(-gpu)
    

* Demo usages
    - faster rcnn
    - Deep Q-Learning

***
## Step by step guide

The guide to set up the whole environment can be found in [my write-ups](this is a website page)

***
## What I have done?

Expect the set up of the environments (which is not so easy)

* Integrate unrealcv with faster rcnn tensorflow implements
* Demo of how to evaluate the existing algorithms

# Case study

***
## Get images (Official Demo)

``` python
# This is a 10 lines python example to show how to generate an image dataset with image, depth and object_mask.
# Read https://unrealcv.github.io/tutorial/getting_started.html before trying this script
# Note: if you need high-accuracy depth, please use `vget /camera/0/depth depth.exr`
import json; camera_trajectory = json.load(open('camera_traj.json'))
from unrealcv import client
client.connect()
# Get object information
obj_info = client.request('vget /objects')
for [loc, rot] in camera_trajectory:
    # Set position of the first camera
    client.request('vset /camera/0/location {x} {y} {z}'.format(**loc))
    client.request('vset /camera/0/rotation {pitch} {yaw} {roll}'.format(**rot))
    # Get image and ground truth
    modes = ['lit', 'depth', 'object_mask']
    [im, dep, obj] = [client.request('vget /camera/0/%s' % m) for m in modes]
    print ['%s is saved to %s' % (k, v) for (k,v) in zip(modes, [im, dep, obj])]
```


***
## Gym_unrealcv (Official Demo)

* Random agent
* DQN

***
## Faster rcnn

. . .

The (unrealcv) official demo need the [rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn with caffe support](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn), which can be not so easy to set up and I personally like tensorflow since it's easy to use and better communities by far.

. . .

I integrate/test one of the tensorflow implements, [smallcorgi/Faster-RCNN_TF](https://github.com/smallcorgi/Faster-RCNN_TF), and all instructions can be found at [my write-ups](this is a website page).


***
## Test algorithms with synthetic data

We show a demo of using different color of sofa generated from the unrealcv and test the faster rcnn implements to see whether they are invariant to color.

Codes can be found at [codes](the code)

# Related Work

We only cover a small aspect of synthetic computer vision:

* Synthetic dataset
* Composite Images
* Virtual/Augmented Reality
* AI2-THOR (The House Of inteRactio, it is highly similar to unrealcv, used Unity 3D)
* ...

. . .
